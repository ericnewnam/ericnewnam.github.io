### Applied Machine Learning Projects

1. [**_What Machine Learning Looks Like Under the Hood: Implementing Gradient Descent._**](https://ericnewnam.github.io/manually-logistic.html)
<br><br>
We will manually implement logistic regression and optimize it with the gradient descent algorithm.

2. [**_Which Features Are King? An Analysis of Different House Characteristics on the Resulting Price in King County USA._**](https://ericnewnam.github.io/sas-king-county-report.html)
<br><br>
King County encompasses Seattle, WA. The goal of the study was to find clear correlations between certain features of the King County house sales dataset, and the resulting house price values. Would it be possible to fit a multi-variate predictive model using regression analysis to predict, with a minimum of error, the dollar value? 

   The study began by re-encoding certain features and performing random sampling to get 1000 observations from the total dataset. The _Price_ feature was also log-transformed after analyzing its distribution. The model was fitted and iteratively improved.

3. [**_Altering Hyperparameters and Their Resulting Effects on the Performance of a Multilayer Perceptron Classifier When Detecting Pulsar Candidates From Sky Survey Data._**](https://ericnewnam.github.io/tf-pulsar-MLP-simplified.html)
<br><br>
The MLP classifier is an algorithm that leverages many artificial "neurons" in its construction, configured in multiple layers. We will execute a series of structured, orderly changes and observe the effects on certain metrics, while gaining an intuitive understanding of the results when invoking certain high-level, or "hyper" parameters. 

   HTRU2 is a data set which describes a sample of pulsar candidates collected during the High Time Resolution Universe Survey. The MLP classifier will attempt to discern the legitimate pulsar examples, which are the minority positive class, while the majority negative class are spurious examples such as radio-frequency interference (RFI) and noise.

4. [**_Factor Analysis: Finding Underlying Factors Within the General Economic Characteristics of American Communities that Affect the Poverty Rate._**](https://ericnewnam.github.io/factor-analysis-census.html)
<br><br>
The data here represents general economic characteristics of all American census tracts and were collected by the US Census Bureau - each observation represents a numbered unique census tract. They are taken from the DP03 and DP05 tables of the 2015 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. 

   Factor analysis was performed in order to determine what factors may be intertwined within the dataset, and may possibly be driving the rate of impoverished workers and impoverished children. This factor analysis will omit the 6 racial categories, and try to determine underlying factors that exist _outside of race/ethnicity_.
