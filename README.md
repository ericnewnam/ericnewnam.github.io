### Applied Machine Learning Projects
<br>
Currently a graduate student - delving into the study of Computer Science with a Data Science concentration area. The current Winter curriculum consists of *Advanced Data Analysis*, and *Programming Machine Learning Applications*. 

While the current state of software engineering has been well-entrenched and established for decades with best-practices in place, the field of data science is still in its adolescent stage. There is a certain attraction to this new sub-field, with plenty of room to evolve as its best-practices and methodologies are still in early development. There is also an analytical aspect to it, ironically requiring *human guidance* and mathematical ability to develop, build, guide, and tune the algorithms, and to interpret the numerical results.

1. [**_Ensemble Learning: The Use of the Random Forest Algorithm to Perform Human Activity Recognition From Wearable Accelerometer Data._**](https://ericnewnam.github.io/sklearn-random-forest.html)
<br><br>
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope.

   We will implement a series of random forests and train the models to discern one of the six potential human activities being performed, based solely on the accelerometer data. Each training iteration of the random forest will have slightly different hyperparameter tunings.

2. [**_Altering Hyperparameters and Their Resulting Effects on the Performance of a Multilayer Perceptron Classifier When Automatically Detecting Pulsar Candidates From RFI Noise_**](https://ericnewnam.github.io/sklearn-pulsar-MLP-various.html)
<br><br>
The MLP classifier is an algorithm that leverages many artificial "neurons" in its construction, configured in multiple layers. We will execute a series of structured, orderly changes and observe the effects on certain metrics, while gaining an intuitive understanding of the results when invoking certain high-level, or "hyper" parameters. 

   HTRU2 is a data set which describes a sample of pulsar candidates collected during the High Time Resolution Universe Survey. The MLP classifier will attempt to discern the legitimate pulsar examples, which are the minority positive class, while the majority negative class are spurious examples such as radio-frequency interference (RFI) and noise.

3. [**_Which Features Are King? An Analysis of Different House Characteristics on the Resulting Price in King County USA._**](https://ericnewnam.github.io/sas-king-county-report.html)
<br><br>
King County encompasses Seattle, WA. The goal of the study was to find clear correlations between certain features of the King County house sales dataset, and the resulting house price values. Would it be possible to fit a multi-variate predictive model using regression analysis to predict, with a minimum of error, the dollar value? 

   The study began by re-encoding certain features and performing random sampling to get 1000 observations from the total dataset. The _Price_ feature was also log-transformed after analyzing its distribution. The model was fitted and iteratively improved.
